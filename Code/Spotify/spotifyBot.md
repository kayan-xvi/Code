This is the explanation file for the spotify bot

naming:
fileNames
FolderNames
variableNames
Function_Names

Things which are predominantly used are lists of track URIs
The aim is to have these used the most for storing tracks

Other normal inputs are:

- Playlist URI
- Dictionary of track/ playlist features

As good practice, the bot should always check for whether there is a duplication which could
Happen by adding tracks whenever this could be the place

Any trackIds being moved around will be in a normal list form
If I need to deal with them in lists of a hundred, that can happen inside a function, but not between them
